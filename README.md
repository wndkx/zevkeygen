If you saw something like that and have an error on third pop-up window, again check if you selected edition correctly. If this does not help too, use 'Activation from my key' below the default activation. Here is [KMS Keys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started/kms-client-activation-keys) that you must use.
